<!-- About me -->
<div id="about" class="row light">
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      I love technology. 
      I've always loved it, and I want to explore it as much as I can. 
      Currently, I am looking for an <strong>internship</strong> in 
      the software industry. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I am great when it comes to communicating with others and 
      <strong>teamwork</strong>. 
      You can check out some of the projects I've done at 
      <a href="https://github.com/mkusm">Github</a>. 
      Also, please take a look at which 
      <a href="#skills">skills</a> 
      I have and which 
      <a href="#courses">courses</a> 
      I have taken. Are you thinking about hiring me? You will not regret it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't have much experience and I am aware of how much more 
      I have to learn. But at the same time I am ambitious, and if you give 
      me a chance, I will prove myself with hard work.
    </p>

    <h2 id="skills" class="skills">My skills</h2>
    <p>
      I am mostly interested in programming in <strong>Python</strong>. 
      I have built the webpage you are looking at from ground up, 
      so I have some basic skills in 
      <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>. 
      Since I use my computer daily with Ubuntu, I'm not scared of using 
      <strong>Unix terminal</strong>. And I am using it to keep control over my
      projects with <strong>Git</strong> and <strong>Github</strong>. 
      Also, I know the basics of <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Side skills:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>My mother tongue is Polish, but 
      I am a profficient English language speaker at  
      <strong>C2</strong> level and I have a Cambridge 
      <strong>certificate</strong> to back it up.</li>
      <li>I have earned my Engineer's Degree with a thesis about 
      <strong>Android mobile app</strong> I've written. I did it
      using <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>XML</strong> and 
      <strong>Android SDK</strong>.</li>
      <li>During my studies I had a chance to code in 
      <strong>C</strong> and <strong>Basic</strong>.</li>
      <li>I have experience in Autocad software, which I used to
      design railroad track cross sections and profiles</li>
      <li>I have a driving licence (category B) </li>
      <li>I used to know basics of Javascipt, 
      but I totally forgot it by now.</li>
      <li>In college they made us learn a lot about <strong>first aid</strong>. 
      No one dies when I'm around.</li>
      <li>I like to think I have a sense of humour.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I am constantly trying to improve myself. 
      So in my spare time, to get to know Windows better, I play computer 
      games ;) I also try to stay healthy doing sports, 
      and from time to time I solve some coding problems on 
      <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/kusm">Codewars</a>, 
      or even post them myself.
